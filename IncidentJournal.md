# Scenario
A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in primary-care services experienced a security incident on Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they could not access files like medical records on their computers. Business operations shut down because employees could not access the files and software needed to do their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers known to target organizations in the healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money for the decryption key. <br/>
<br/>
The attackers were able to gain access to the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware once downloaded on the employee's computer.<br/>
<br/>
Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company could not access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in its business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.<br/>

Additional notes:<br/>
- Need to determine the exact number of affected systems and the scope of encrypted data
- Priority to verify if Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) was compromised 
- It is important to establish if backup systems are available and uncompromised
- Must verify the last known good backup of patient data
- Need to document the exact timeline from phishing email receipt to encryption
- Should investigate which employee(s) opened malicious attachments for post-incident training
- Consider implementing network segregation to prevent future lateral movement
- Need to establish if other clinics in the area received similar phishing attempts
- Must ensure HIPAA breach notification requirements are met if applicable
- Recommended to engage digital forensics team for investigation
- Should review email security controls and anti-phishing measures
