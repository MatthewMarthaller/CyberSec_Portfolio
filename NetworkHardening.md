(NOTE: This is based on a fictional scenario.)

# Scenario
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. <br/>
<br/>
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:<br/>

    1) The organization’s employees share passwords.

    2) The admin password for the database is set to the default.

    3) The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

    4) Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. <br/>
<br/>
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. <br/>
<br/>
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network. <br/>

# Recommendations <br/>

## Recommendation 1: Password Policies & MFA <br/>
I strongly recommend implementing robust password policies and multifactor authentication (MFA) for our organization. Given the recent data breach, it's crucial to ensure employees no longer share passwords, but instead use unique, complex passwords. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access from password sharing or weak credentials. This would also apply to the Admin credentials to force them off Default to limit access to the administrative services.  <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, MFA adds a critical layer by requiring a second form of verification, such as a one-time code, making it much harder for attackers to gain access even if passwords are compromised. This approach is vital for safeguarding our customers’ data and preventing future breaches. <br/>

## Recommendation 2: Firewall Maintenance & Port Filtering
To protect our network from future data breaches, I advise establishing comprehensive firewall maintenance and port filtering practices. <br/>
Our network is currently vulnerable without effective firewall rules, leaving us exposed to unauthorized access and attacks. By regularly updating and configuring firewalls to align with our security policies, we can ensure that only legitimate traffic is allowed. <br/> 
<br/>
Port filtering is essential, as it involves closing unnecessary ports and restricting open ports to essential services, which reduces potential attack vectors. These measures will help fortify our network, maintaining the integrity and security of our customers’ personal information.
